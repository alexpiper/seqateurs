\title{output a FASTA file from a phyloseq object}
\usage{
ps_to_fasta(ps = ps, out.file = NULL, seqnames = "unique", width = 1000, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{A \code{phyloseq} object that contains \code{\link[phyloseq]{refseq}}.
If there the \code{refseq} slot is not filled, this function will try pull the
sequences from \code{\link[phyloseq]{get_taxa}}}

\item{seqnames}{(optional) A taxonomic rank from the \code{\link[phyloseq]{tax_table}} which will be used to name the sequences.
alternatively "unique" will uniquely name the sequences as \code{ASV_#},
"sequence" will name the sequences in the fasta exactly the same same as the sequence, usfull for LULU curation.}

\item{width}{(Default 1000) The number of characters in each fasta line before wrapping occurs}

\item{...}{(Optional) Any further paramaters to be passed to \code{writeXStringSet}}

\item{file}{(optional) A file name that ends in ".fasta" or ".fa".
If a file name is not supplied, the file will be named after the phyloseq object.}
}
\value{
This function saves a FASTA-formatted text file from the input \code{phyloseq} object.
}
\description{
This function outputs a FASTA-formatted text file from a \code{phyloseq} object.
